# Presentation about HTML, CSS, SCSS

This project was used to tell my colleagues about five frontend questions:

1. Semantic HTML / _1-semantic-html_  
Told why semantic tags matter and spoke about some popular semantic tags and common mistakes. Also, told why we still need `<div />`.
2. CSS units / _2-units_  
I spoke about the most popular units: `px`, `rem`, `em`, `vh`, `vw`, `%`. Told why we need `rem` and pointed out the nuances of using percentages.
3. SCSS code style, important rules and selectors / _3-styles_  
Told about how to write better SCSS code. Spoke about `position: sticky`, `display: grid`, and `> :not(:last-child)`.
4. CSS in JS  / _4-css-in-js_  
Told about the pros and cons of using CSS in JS approach and about the `styled-components` library.
5. Bonus theme: memoization in React / _5-bonus_  
Told about two cases when we need to use `useCallback` and about the common mistake of devs who use it (using `useCallback` without `memo` func).
